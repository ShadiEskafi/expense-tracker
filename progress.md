# Inter-Session Narrative Memory & Progress Tracker

> **Project**: Expense Management App  
> **Harness Status**: Active & Enforced  
> **Last Updated**: 2026-10-24  
> **Single Source of Truth**: [project-summary.md](file:///f:/SHADI/2-Programming/Expense%20Tracker%20App/expense-tracker/project-summary.md) & [design-system/](file:///f:/SHADI/2-Programming/Expense%20Tracker%20App/expense-tracker/design-system/)

---

## 1. Executive Status
The project harness engineering foundation has been established with all 5 core subsystems:
1. **Instructions**: Compact `AGENTS.md` (<150 lines), deep-dive rules in `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/testing-standards.md`, and complete Arabic-first RTL design system in `design-system/`.
2. **State Persistence**: `progress.md` (this file), `feature_list.json` (20 verified feature triplets), `DECISIONS.md` (9 ADRs preventing context drift).
3. **Verification Health Gate**: Executable `init.ps1` and `init.sh` running lint, vitest automated tests, and production build with zero errors.
4. **Scope Containment**: Strict WIP=1 policy enforced through `feature_list.json`.
5. **Lifecycle Contract**: Cold-start protocol and session exit checklist.

## 2. Completed Milestones
- [x] Product Discovery & Requirements Elicitation (All 22 axes resolved).
- [x] Project Specification Frozen (`project-summary.md` Final v1.0).
- [x] Functional Specification Defined (`figma-prompt.md` Final v1.0).
- [x] Comprehensive Arabic-First RTL Design System established (`design-system/` with 19 detailed documentation files).
- [x] Automated Test Harness configured (`vitest` installed, `src/smoke.test.js` passing).
- [x] Health Gates implemented (`init.ps1` & `init.sh` passing with 0 errors).
- [x] Machine-readable Feature Triplets cataloged (`feature_list.json` with F001 - F020).
- [x] Architectural Decision Records documented (`DECISIONS.md` with ADR-001 through ADR-012).
- [x] **F001**: Local-First IndexedDB Schema & Database Client (`src/db/db.js`, `src/db/db.test.js` with 9 passing tests).
- [x] **F002**: Monetary Precision & ISO 4217 Minor Units Engine (`src/utils/currency.js`, `src/utils/currency.test.js` with 34 passing tests).

## 3. Current Focus & WIP Limit (WIP=1)
- **Active Feature**: None currently in progress (`state: not-started`).
- **Next Feature in Queue**: **F003** (`Deterministic Category Pre-seeding`).

---

## 4. Blockers & Risks
- **Blockers**: None. Full health pipeline (lint, 44 vitest tests, vite build) passing with 0 errors.
- **Risks & Mitigations**:
  - *Browser Storage Eviction*: Mitigated by calling `navigator.storage.persist()` and providing complete atomic JSON backup/restore.
  - *Multi-Device Concurrency*: Mitigated by Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) and conflict archiving in `conflict_audit_log`.

## 5. Handoff Protocol for Next Session / Agent
1. Execute `./init.ps1` (or `./init.sh`) to confirm zero regressions.
2. Read `progress.md` and `DECISIONS.md`.
3. Pick **F003** from `feature_list.json`, transition `state: active`.
4. Implement deterministic category pre-seeding (`src/services/category.js` and `src/services/category.test.js`).
5. Verify test pass (`npm test src/services/category.test.js`), update `feature_list.json` to `passing` with evidence, and commit.
